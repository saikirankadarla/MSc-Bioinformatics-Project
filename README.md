Title:- Unlocking triadic nexus of interrelationship between tau,amyloid beta and alpha-synuclein in Neurodegenerative Disorders to Identify Novel Drug Targets through structure based drug design
Methodology:-
•	1.Gathering the data set of proteins from BioGRID 
•	2.Construction of protein-protein interactions using cytoscape
•	3.Integration of ppi network with known data in Genemania and string databases to get a network of interactors of proteins
•	4.Analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for identifying direct and indirect interactions between tau (MAPT), alpha-synuclein (SNCA), and amyloid-beta (APP) for finding common protein involved with the interactions.
•	5.The protein sequences were retrieved from the UniProt database for predicting protein structures using alphafold3.
•	6.The common protein involved interactions with Tau, alpha-synuclein, and amyloid-beta are docked with Cluspro webserver.
•	7.The constructed PPI network of proteins can be given as input in Reactome database to get common molecular pathways
•	8.The ligands were designed and modified functional groups using Biovia Draw 2025
•	9.Docking of proteins with designed specific ligands using PyRx software.

Future work:- The constructed network of proteins involved in interactions can be utilized to identify common molecular pathways using Reactome.The common protein interacted with tau (MAPT), alpha-synuclein (SNCA), and amyloid-beta (APP) can be utilized for designing drug targets using Biovia Draw 2025 software and Docked with ligands using PyRx Software.
